# EmpowerTreeChart

**Challenges and desired improvements:**
- I notice that the function I wrote is quite verbose and ideally would be easier to read and cleaner
- I would like to have figured out a way switch off adding vertical shapes and adding horizontal shapes as opposed to creating the maximum 4 quadrants with vertical slices in them, which seems to stretch things vertically as opposed to a more balanced horizontal-vertical ratio
- I wonder if drawing differently could have made it easier (i.e. drawRect as opposed to using dynamic y and x coordinates to draw lines)
- I would like to have added a text element displaying the element's value (number) in each space
  
**Reflections:**
- I spent a couple hours on this. I realize it was requested to try to only spend an hour on it, but I had errors with the drawing portion of this after the first hour and spent the remainder fixing the drawing of the canvas.
- Every array I've tried so far does divide up as intended
- I enjoyed being required to create a flat view as opposed to using special ViewGroups provided by Android
